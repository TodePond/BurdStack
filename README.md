# BurdStack
Just documenting my social media stack...

First let's map out everything I use! I consider these all to be social media in some form:

* youtube
* patreon
* mastodon
* twitter
* instagram
* github
* reddit: (various)
* whatsapp: (various)
* discord: lilypad
* discord: t2 tile
* discord: sandspiel
* discord: emergence
* discord: tldraw
* slack: future of coding

Next time, let's categorise them by how I use them...
